<img class="h-left" alt="square" src="/images/uploads/2014/04/square-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" />Thought I'd post this up as I've spent time on it and it's good to have my code examples up somewhere to look at when I need to.

This is the result of a job test I was required to do, the remit being to show lists of pages on a theoretical website with their load time in milliseconds and show it in a graph form. Not having done much work with graphing before and making some baby steps into the world of Angular I figured if I was going to be giving up my time to do this, I may as well learn as I went.

I used [the excellent Dan Wahlin tutorial](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/04/12/video-tutorial-angularjs-fundamentals-in-60-ish-minutes.aspx "I actually used the PDF") as a jumping off point for the project, adapting where needed and having done a bit of research saw that pablojim had written an [angular directive for high-charts](https://github.com/pablojim/highcharts-ng "angular directive") which were very pretty. See also the [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/pablojim/Hjdnw/ "jsFiddle Highcharts").

The [final app is here](/demo/angular-app/index.html "angular app demo".

And you can [check it out on github](https://githhub.com/StevenFewster/ncc "Angular Exmaple").

Enjoy.
