This one was an easy choice as we had some of that lovely Elderflower Liqueur "St Germain" left over from our wedding &#8211; it goes very nicely in a glass of champagne, but only a little bit. Also any opportunity to break out the Noilly Prat.

The original recipe called for Bulleit Bourbon but I've used Makers Mark here instead. Here's the ingredients:

Another nice straightforward method for putting it all together, everything in the shaker with ice, shake and pour. Then pop in a cherry that you will ultimately have to give to your better half anyway.

And here we have the final result. Apologies for the quite awful photography but it gives you a bit of an idea of colour and things.

## The Verdict

Emma is not really a huge fan of whiskies and bourbons but she quite enjoyed it.  It certainly is the dominant flavour in the cocktail.  The dry vermouth helps balance out the very sweet liqueur making it  a nice well-rounded drink.  There's no doubting just how alcoholic it is but it's pleasant enough that you could knock back a couple no problem 
>would definitely have again but would try to keep hold of the cherry!
