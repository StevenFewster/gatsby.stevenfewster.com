Quite some time ago I was introduced by [Bob from the Trinity](http://www.trinity-bar.com/ "Trinity Bar Harrow") to [Difford's Cocktail Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0955627621 "Diffords Guide Version 10 on Amazon").  A battered version 7 of the book, it tweaked my interest and I have since bought version 8 and more recently version 10 (version 8 having had an accident with some exuberant friends of my better half).

I can't recommend it highly enough but I thought I might pay homage to it by working my way through the book doing one letter of the alphabet each time and giving you my oh-so-invaluable insights. Also something else to put on here rather than the rather dry computing references.

One, not problem per se, but feature of the book is it's really quite specific references to particular brands.  Thanks to an ex colleague moving to Canada I managed to inherit a fairly substantial collection of spirits to add to my own, so I beg your forgiveness for liberties taken with ingredients.  This first one, for example, I have substituted Bulleit Bourbon for Maker's Mark.

Here laid out are all the ingredients. Proper planning prevents poor performance. That line would have been better under whatever it is I end up making for P.

And here is the final result.  Not particularly evenly poured.  I went for this one as it caught my eye flicking through for it's use of apricot jam.

## The Verdict

I quite liked it. It was very sweet but the bourbon gave it a nice edge.  Emma's comment: 

>it was alright but I wouldn't rush to have another.  

Had to finish hers for her.  Altruism at its finest.   I might come back and give these ratings at a later date.
