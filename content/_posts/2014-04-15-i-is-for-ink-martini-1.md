Not quite as inky as I'd hoped for but quite a pleasing colour. I'm having to imagine what it would be like with the Peach Scnhapps. Not as over powered by Mandarin I would imagine, as that is the main thing I'm getting from this. It's okay, but won't be rushing to make it again. I'd describe it more as a number two. Shame.
