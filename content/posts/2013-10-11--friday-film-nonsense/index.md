*The Rules*: Name your film night and state the three films that you will be showing.

This comes out of a drunken conversation with&#8230; someone. I think Emma. Maybe Clem. Possibly someone else. We were discussing what we would show on a film night and the theme. It doesn't necessarily have to be your favourite three &#8211; could just be good examples of a genre or something that means something to you.

My surprise selection (as in "<em>it's a surprise they're not eighties comedies</em>") are:

*Defining Films of the 90's*: 

* [Trainspotting](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/?ref_=nv_sr_1 "IMDB Trainspotting")
* [Reservoir Dogs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/?ref_=nv_sr_1 "IMDB Reservoir Dogs")
* [Fight Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=nv_sr_1 "IMDB Fight Club")

Shawshank just bubbling under in favour of the British entry.

Thinking now, I could have gone for MeatLoaf night: Fight Club, Wayne's World, Rocky Horror Picture Show and actually served MeatLoaf as a snack. I'll stick with my selection though.

Share yours!
