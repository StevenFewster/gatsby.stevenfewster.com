They're back! I'm sure having been missed by absolutely nobody at all.

The G in G &amp; Tea is Gin, obviously. We made this one up a couple of months ago when we were going through a "Gin Phase".  Like a Gin Fizz, but more wobbly. Gin is a lovely summer drink and the Tea in question adds a nice background flavour and makes the short drink long.

## Ingredients

Our Elderflower liqueur is making another reappearance, so it's just add to the shaker with some ice, pour out and top up with soda water. Most of which exploded all over me when I opened it &#8211; drinking has it's dangers!

## Result

And below is the final result.  Nice colour. I've topped it up with quite a lot of soda water.

## Verdict

I'm just off to make another one, that should give away exactly what we thought of it.  The elderflower and tea worked really well together.  I ended up using Earl Grey rather than British Breakfast tea as suggested by Difford's.  Gave it all a lovely aroma and was nice and flowery throughout.  So far, outside of a raspberry one I did free-form in the summer and not mentioned on here, our favourite so far!
