Continuing the series of my A to Z walk-through of cocktails, this is a creation of my own.
Not many pictures for this I'm afraid as I knocked it together myself with some blueberries we had left over from a mixed fruit pack from Sainsbury's that was nearing its use by date.  Neither myself or the mrs are particularly keen on blueberries but this one turned out okay.

## Ingredients

* 15-20 fresh Blueberries
* 2 shots of Tanqueray Gin
* 1 shot of Creme de Framboise
* 1 shot of Chambord
* 2 shots of Apple Juice


## Method
Muddle the Blueberries in the base of the cocktail shaker.  Add the rest of the ingredients with ice and shake.  Strain in to martini glasses.

## Verdict
Was really quite nicely balanced for both both of us.  Nice and fruity but not too sweet.  Next time I will probably fine strain through a proper sieve as the little blueberry seeds settled at the bottom of the glass.  Would try again. If I had blueberries to use up.
