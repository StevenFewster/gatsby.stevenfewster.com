This is a favourite of mine that I used to make at a friend's "soirees" and that proved to be popular.  Also handy is that we just had a pirate barbeque meaning we had lots of rum left over so this nice fruity cocktail helped demolish a bit of that.  The original recipe calls for vodka rather than rum so it's a bit odd that I've always seemed to use rum.

It's another nice straightforward one involving pineapple juice, rum and chambord (the holy hand grenade of antioch - though they've since re-modelled the bottle so it's not quite 
[as glam as it used to be](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chambord_Liqueur_Royale_de_France.jpg)).

## Ingredients <small>(makes two</small>:

* 4 shots Bacardi Superior Rum
* 3 shots Pineapple Juice

The Resultant output is below. Shake all ingredients over ice, it ended up looking like it had egg white in it which was unexpected.

## The Verdict

We both enjoyed this one.  The rum really came through which I'm guessing wouldn't be as overpowering if we'd used vodka instead. Also when I'm freestyling I tend to put in more chambord and more pineapple which makes it that bit more fruity but was very refreshing on a hot day in the garden. Thumbs up from Emma too!
