This cocktail I made back in the old house with an aim to do something like this so I can save myself some time and post the ingredients and results here. Or I might just make it again, it was good.

It took getting hold of some Agavero tequila liqueur which meant a trip up to [the whiskey exchange highly recommended](http://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/ "The Whiskey Exchange") near where I was working in London Bridge. I can highly recommend it for a lot of things in the Difford's guide that's a bit more exotic.

The other major ingredient is Jamaican ginger beer which I went through a hankering for back when I started all this dabbling in cocktails.  Enough &#8211; here's the ingredients pre-quaffage:


And the final result:

## Verdict

It was as good as I remember if no better as I took my time with it a bit more.

## Bonus Cocktail:

Here's *the Diplomat*. Happened to be on the page opposite and I saw I had all the ingredients (having nabbed some Fee Brothers Orange Bitters in Marks and Sparks when I was in there. Then I saw that I didn't have martini rosso and used martini bianco. Then I saw I didn't have a maraschino liqueur and used amaretto instead. The result:

## Verdict

A very sweet martini.  Wasn't too keen but easy to drink for the volume of alcohol in there. By the end of the glass it had grown on me.  Emma's verdict was that: 

>one or two would be fine but couldn't drink them all night. 

Well no. I'd be scraping her off the floor!
