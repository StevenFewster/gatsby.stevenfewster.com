So I've already done "F" but I noticed this one when I was flicking through and really wanted to go back and have a crack at it when I eventually had all the ingredients.<!--more--> Following a trip to my favourite Whisky Exchange on Friday, I now had all the bits I needed to make it bar a Cadbury's Flake. Having got the missing bit at Sainsbury's on Saturday, it was time to treat Mrs F to another cocktail. Here's the ingredients assembled (note: chocolate bitters are in shot but not used. I'm thinking I might next time).

## Method/Result

That should all be poured into a shaker with ice in the quantities dictated by Difford's and then poured over crushed ice. The people with a basic reading age amongst you will have noticed ice twice in that sentence, the others are looking at the pretty patterns the letters make. The basic point is that without ice you're going to be drinking at best a lukewarm creamy cocktail. Which is (a) where we found ourselves and (b) why I'm going to have another crack tomorrow.

I made this up with double quantities and it still only half filled the glasses because it's meant to be poured over some ice.

That being said: End result was lovely. Improvements would be to change up the own brand Baileys for the real thing, it always has the kind of bite at the end that you just don't get with the real deal. Also I might alter the quantities of Raspberry vodka in favour of the Frangelico. Because I like Frangelico.

Here's some horrifically grainy shots:

And the second one:

## Verdict

Mrs F really liked and will be demanding again. Just as well as we now have a bottle of White Chocolate liqueur to use, and is expounding it's virtues to her mum on the phone now so I guess I'll be making another for their next visit too. Just need play with the mix to get it to my tastes&#8230;

## Update
So seeing as we had some cream to use up we had another go the next day.  This time I upped the measure of Frangelico and added some Cherry Brandy, while also using a couple of pippettefuls of Chocolate Bitters.  It made a measurable improvement and I've decided to christen it <strong>Fruit and Nut (Schwarzwald).</strong>

Measures were roughly:
  * 2 measures Rasberry Absolut</li>
  * 2 measures Frangelico</li>
  * 1 measure Chocolate Liqueur</li>
  * 1 measure Baileys</li>
  * 1 measure Cherry Brandy</li>
  * 1.5 measures Milk</li>
  * 1.5 measures Double Cream</li>
  * 2 drops Chocolate Bitters</li>
    

Enjoy!
