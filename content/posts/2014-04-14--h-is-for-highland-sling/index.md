When Monday has given you a kicking, a sling seems highly appropriate. Looking for an 'H' and finding that I had all the pre requisites for this cheeky little number, I managed to get it made up before the Mrs got home!

## Ingredients

Admittedly it was a "better" brand of Scotch requested but as I had some I thought what the hey. It says something about hte state of my drinks cabinet now that all I had to head out and get was the juice.
Here it is in all it's pre-mix glory!

![Highland Sling Ingredients](/images/uploads/2014/04/2014-04-14-19.00.21-HDR.jpg "Highland Sling Ingredients")

* Bells Whiskey
* Galliano
* Apricot Brandy
* Apple Juice
* Cranberry Juice

## Method

Dead simple, as are all the ones I go for - shake together with ice. I should have put more ice in the glass as it turns out.

## The Result

Ah - isn't it pretty! Lovely and fruity. The scotch is obviously the overpowering taste in the whole thing but the Galliano and other fruit-based accompaniments balance it out nicely. Fruity punch with a nice mellow Scoth after-taste. Would make again!
